# monty-hall
This Java program is based on the Monty Hall brain teaser, which was based off of the popular game show, Let's Make a Deal, and named after its original host, Monty Hall.

The Monty Hall problem is a probability puzzle. The idea, based on the game show, is that you are shown three doors. You know that behind one of the three doors, there is a valuable prize, in the case of my program, a car. You also know that behind the two remaining doors, there are goats. You are first allowed to select one door.

Once you have selected your door, one of the other two doors will be opened, revealing its contents. After you have seen the contents, you are allowed a second choice: do you keep your originally selected door? Or do you now select the other door that has yet to be opened?

While it is not always guaranteed, you have a greater probability of winning the car if you choose to switch your original door to the third, not yet selected or opened door. 

This is due to the fact that you start out with 1/3 probability of selecting the door with the car behind it. Once a door is opened, you can choose to switch your door which changes your odds to 1/2 instead of 1/3. Because of this, you have a greater chance of winning a car if you choose to switch your doors.
